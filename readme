i have included both the 32 bit and the 64 bit drivers if you need them. 
if you are unsure about which ones to use, use the 64 bit installer if it loads then you know you have 64 bit ;)

when prompted choose samsung and click yes on any/all popups to install samsung's mobile drivers.

then run the run.bat as admin (right click and run as administrator), 
if it gives errors please wait 2-3 mins and try again as the computer might be installing drivers
